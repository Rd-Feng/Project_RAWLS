# Project_RAWLS

A blockchain (ETH) web app that Holberton students Rui Feng, Sumin Yu, Jian Huang, Nicole Swanson, and Bryan Leung made under the mentorship of Magali Bohn, Xavier Lesage Moretti, and Evelyn de Souza.
We made a working MVP that uses Ethereum to sign smart contracts with any company that uses an IoT device to gather data.

The idea behind DOIL or Project RAWLS is to aid companies that gather data, specifically regarding privacy and personal data.
This app obtains full consent of permissions and users can opt in to sell their data for money.
This is wonderful due to today's privacy concerns. 

Tech used was React, the web trinity, and the database is stored on a small black box located at our school.
Although primitive, our MVP works and this was a great learning experience for all.

We have many future ideas and implementations we are working on but just so you remember, this is just a side project for us students.
