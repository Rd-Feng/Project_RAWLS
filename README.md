## About Rawls

A blockchain (ETH) web app that Holberton students Rui Feng, Sumin Yu, Jian Huang, Nicole Swanson, and Bryan Leung made under the mentorship of Magali Bohn, Xavier Lesage Moretti, and Evelyn de Souza.
This is a working MVP that uses Ethereum to sign smart contracts. Users give companies conscent and permission with the data that IoT device(s) gather.

The idea behind Project RAWLS (formerly DOIL) is to aid companies with privacy and consumer's concerns with their personal data.
This app obtains full consent of permissions and stores them in blockchain. Users can opt-in or allow companies to use their data, in exchange for money.
This is wonderful due to today's privacy concerns.

Tech used was Solidity, React, the web trinity, and Firebase.
Although primitive, our MVP works and this was a great learning experience for all.

### Future Implementations and Bugs

Disclaimer: We are full time students and this was a side project. We completely changed the look of the site and did a full overhaul in the last month before demoing.

* The values for contracts are hard coded. We need to partner with companies and obtain actual prices that they would be willing to pay for certain data categories. The back end is connected and this can be incorporated.  
* Mobile and smaller width responsiveness. Our first version was fully mobile friendly but our most updated version traded beauty for responsiveness.  
* ADA compliant. WAI-ARIA.  
* Secruity and encryption for the database, SSL certification, https for the site, firewalls, etc.  
* Duplicate the infrastructure so there is no SPOF. Need load balancers if this ever gets enough traffic.  
* Better visuals and custom artwork for branding.
